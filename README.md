			Hello my lovely friend.

			Unfortunately, today is the day I'm shutting down GitGardener :(


			I really loved it. Honestly. After all, it was my first project that people

			actually used, and even paid money for.


			Fast forward two years later, and I've built another twenty products,

			with one of them becoming so successful that I actually doubled my salary

			and quit pursuing my dreams.


			Without GitGardener, and my first ever paying customers, I would have quit.

			So, if it wasn't for you specifically, I wouldn't be living my dreams right now.

			And I can't thank you enough for that!


			The reality is that this project requires maintenance. And, unfortunately

			I don't have that time anymore.

			As for your subscription, don't worry at all.


			I have already canceled it for you from the back end. You will no longer be charged.

			Also, if you were on an annual plan, I have refunded you the remaining amount of time.

			
			Once again, thank you for everything. You helped me change my life. I can only hope that I helped you a little with my bot :)

			Feel free to reach out to me at alexcs02356@gmail.com, if you have any questions or just want to say hi.

			
			Much love!

			Your friend from GitGardener, Alex
