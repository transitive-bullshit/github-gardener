			You are using now using Stealth Mode <3

			One quick thing! I had an idea and built a new feature!

			The bot can now push automated pull requests, code reviews and issues.

			That means you can now have a green contribution history and a diamond contribution chart!

			It's called Ninja Mode and it costs $10/mo, two cups coffees per month :P

			You can upgrade to Ninja by visiting www.githubgardener.co

			Thank you for supporting me chasing my dream, that of living by doing what I love most, it means the world to me <3

			Please, make sure to find me and even DM me on Twitter @alexsideris_ or in the chatbox at githubgardener.co
